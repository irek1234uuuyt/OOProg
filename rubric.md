# Project Assessment Rubric

**Project:** CaJerBank
**Section:** C2B
**Course:** Object Oriented Programming

## Grading Breakdown

### 1. Class Diagram Completeness (25%)
**Score:** 5/5
**Notes:** Complete UML class diagram provided as PNG file (CajerBank UML.png) locally in the project directory. The diagram is accessible and shows class relationships clearly.

### 2. Java Program - OOP Concepts (50%)
**Score:** 4/5
**Notes:** Strong implementation of OOP concepts:
- **Encapsulation:** Private fields in Account class (accNum, pin, balance) with public getters/setters
- **Inheritance:** UserAccount extends abstract Account class
- **Polymorphism:** Abstract method showInfo() overridden in UserAccount; Serializable interface implemented
- **Abstraction:** Abstract Account class demonstrates abstraction
However, the code is relatively simple with limited complexity. Only one concrete class extends Account, which shows basic but not comprehensive OOP usage.

### 3. Git Usage & Collaboration (15%)
**Score:** 4/5
**Notes:** Good collaboration with 5 contributors: Erick (20 commits), irek1234uuuyt (3 commits), CASSIE (2 commits), Michael Ong (1 commit), and sephy (1 commit). Shows active team participation with one primary contributor.
